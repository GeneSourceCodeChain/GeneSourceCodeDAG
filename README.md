# GeneSourceCodeDAG

The Gene Source Code Foundation is committed to build the world's first storage
and decentralized application platform for genomic and health data, the Gene Source Code System, with the expectation that a human healthcare data ecosystem will be built around this and create one unique Economic Mechanism: Encourage users to share genomic and health data within the ecosystem, provide researchers with adequate data support and provide data users with a friendly interface.

This project is to implement a library managing DAG objects such as block chain, merkle tree and merkle-patricia tree for Gene Source Code Chain. 

### Introduction

This project is going to proceed in triple steps:

1. first phase: We will build a DApp with EOS, and gradually develop Marketing functions and Sharing functions
2. second phase: We will do relevant research on existing public chain and future blockchain multilayer structure, and choose a viable path to achieve the required functions of Gene Source Code Chain Structure.
3. third phase: We are going to implement a blockchain system or a layer structure to serve the Gene Source Code Chain ecosystem


1) EOS.IO wrapper (EOSWrapper)

Wrapper library which controls the EOS.IO toolkits. The demo provide an example of how to start a multi-node testnet.

2) EOS launcher scripts (EOSDeployer)

scripts for launching EOS testnet in one command

3) ETH launcher scripts (ETHDeployer)

scripts for launching ETH testnet easily
